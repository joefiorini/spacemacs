#+TITLE: flow-type layer

* Description
This layer adds some [[https://flowtype.org/][flow]] related functionality to Emacs:
 - Show the flow-type of the object under the cursor using Eldoc
 - Add flow checking to flycheck (based on the flycheck-flow package)
 - company-mode completion using company-flow
 - "compilation" using =flow status= and =flow check=
 - auto staring =flow server= in a project specific comint buffer

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =flow-type= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. Please ensure you already have the flow binary installed and in your PATH.

To prevent the flow server from auto-starting, set =flow-type/no-auto-start= to =t=.
To start the server in a comint buffer on entering a =js2-mode= buffer, set it to ='process=.
